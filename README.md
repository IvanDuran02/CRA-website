# Created using create-react-app
This is one of the first websites I made where I learned about React routing (react-router-dom) and a lot of styling components etc... as well as best practices for css naming conventions and so forth.

overall just a really simple site that could use a lot of improvments in terms of rendering (is a little slow and data is static so SSR would help)
might refactor or just rewrite the whole thing from scratch at some point( not using CRA though )
